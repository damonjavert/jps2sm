Welcome to jps2sm

jps2sm allows easy migration of torrents from JPopSuki to SugoiMusic. Data is gathered from JPS and then uploads are created in SugoiMusic.

Created SugoiMusic uploads specified can either be:

* JPS Group URL - every release in the group is created
* JPS Release URL(s) - only the specified releases in the same group are created, useful if you ned to exclude some releases.
* All torrents uploaded by a given user
* All torrents seeding by a given user.

jps2sm is a command-line / console tool. There is currently no GUI.

Quickstart - if you are familiar with the shell / terminal etc.

1. Edit lib/jps2sm.cfg in your favourite text editor and enter your JPS and SM login details and save.
2. From terminal run jps2sm --help to get started.

Quickstart - for those not familiar with the shell / terminal etc.

1. Double click 'jps2sm.cfg', select Choose Application and choose TextEdit. Enter your JPS and SM login details using the template and save.
2. Hold Command+Space and type 'terminal' press enter
3. Change to the jps2sm directory, type 'cd <jps2sm dir>' this could be 'cd ~/Downloads/jps2sm-jps2sm-macosx-x86_64-x.x' (replacing x.x with your version)
4. Type './jps2sm --help' to get started.

FAQ:

Help me! Its not working!
Come to the SugoiMusic Discord where someone can help.

Why are there so many files? Can everything be in one file?
If all the required libraries are built into one packed exe file jps2sm becomes very slow. These files are 'hidden' in the lib directory and the jps2sm symlink can be used.

Is there a GUI?
No. It is not currently on the roadmaps but it could be done in the future

Does jps2sm send any login credentials to a 3rd-party?
No, jps2sm only sends your JPS and SM credentials to the relevent trackers, no cloud / 3rd-party server is involved.
